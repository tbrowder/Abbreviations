Algorithm to get the set of minimum-length keys for an input word list:

  %ow - make a hash to hold the original words with a list of valid
        abbreviations

  %w - make a working hash of first characters (key length = 1)
       with values a list of those words with that leading character.

  For each key in the working hash, %w, add the keys with single 
  value elements to the master hash, %m, and remove the key from
  the working hash, %w.

  While the working hash has more than one element, break the hash 
  into N+1-character keys and repeat.
